1. Background
After coming home from the office, I was sitting on my couch,
sipping a cup of coffee, and feeling quite tired. That’s when I heard
my son asking me to get him some soaps shaped like animals.
Since I’m always teaching him how to make things ourselves, I
grabbed this opportunity and said, “Let’s do it ourselves.” Atharva
was stunned and asked if this was really possible.
2. Planning and Shopping.
Not knowing how to make soap, I wondered if I had taken on an
activity that was too big to realize. But after spending some time on
YouTube, I realized it’s not as hard as I originally thought. With the
commercial availability of melt-and-pour soap bases on Amazon
and Flipkart, I soon felt it was something fairly doable.
I made a list of things we needed, which included:
• A good soap base (https://amzn.in/d/j5kL0a3)
• Essential oils (https://amzn.in/d/4Y8hoQX)
• Colorants (https://amzn.in/d/aICJNQi)
• Molds (https://amzn.in/d/digKTPs)
I ensured we had kettles and bowls for double boiling in the
kitchen.
I was amazed by the variety of molds available online, and molds
for making animal soaps were pretty cheap.
3. Execution.
Soon after the shipments arrived home, on a Sunday morning, I
spent time with Atharva explaining the steps to create soaps. He
was eager to know more and had many questions, like why
essential oils have no color and whether he could use them for
other purposes.
He started opening the packages and cutting the soap base into
smaller chunks. I was concerned about the sharpness of the cutter
and warned him a couple of times, but he managed to cut the soap
base into really good cubes.
Heating the soap base was my biggest fear, as we had to deal with
fire. I asked him to take a back seat while I handled this part, but
he insisted on participating. He sat next to the stove and gently
followed my instructions. Soon, the soap base was liquefied.
We arranged the molds on another table, and I poured the hot
liquid into the molds. I gave him the colors and essential oils to
add. Being a bit naughty, he added more than I had instructed, but
I didn’t want to spoil his fun.
4. Watching the Magic happen.
It was amazing to see Atharva’s excitement as he mixed the colors
and chose the scents. We had a few spills, but they added to the
fun and learning. Watching the soap harden was like waiting for a
surprise to unfold.
He then wanted to gift these soaps to his grandparents, so I
ordered molds that were oval in shape. We made another batch of
soaps for the elders. This time, I wanted to teach him how to sell
stuff. He started marketing his soaps and sold them for Rs.10
each, and the soaps were sold out in no time.
We hope you enjoyed this soap-making adventure! Try it out and
share your creations with us. Stay tuned for next week’s activity
where we’ll be exploring something new. It’s going to be a blast!

5. Safety Tips for Soap-Making with Kids
Supervision: Always supervise children closely when they are
handling sharp objects or hot liquids.
Protective Gear: Ensure kids wear protective gear like aprons,
gloves, and safety goggles to protect their skin and eyes from hot
soap and other chemicals.
Safe Cutting: Use child-safe knives or cutters and teach proper
cutting techniques to avoid injuries.
Heat Precautions: Handle all heating elements yourself. Keep
children at a safe distance from the stove and boiling water.
Ventilation: Work in a well-ventilated area to avoid inhaling fumes
from essential oils or heated soap bases.
Clean Workspace: Keep the workspace clean and free of clutter to
prevent accidents. Wipe up any spills immediately.
Emergency Preparedness: Have a first aid kit on hand and know
basic first aid procedures in case of minor burns or cuts.
6. Educational Tidbits About Soap-Making
History of Soap: Soap-making dates back to ancient Babylon
around 2800 BC. Early soaps were made using animal fats and
wood ash.
How Soap Works: Soap molecules have a hydrophilic (water-
attracting) head and a hydrophobic (water-repelling) tail. This
structure allows soap to emulsify oils and dirt, making them easier
to wash away.
Saponification: The process of making soap is called
saponification. It’s a chemical reaction between fats or oils and a
base (like lye) that produces soap and glycerin.
Essential Oils: Essential oils are extracted from plants and used
for their aromatic and therapeutic properties. They can have
calming, energizing, or healing effects depending on the type.
Natural vs. Synthetic Colors: Soap can be colored using natural
ingredients like beet juice, turmeric, or spirulina, or synthetic
colorants. Natural colorants are often preferred for their gentle,
non-toxic properties.
Soap Bases: Melt and pour soap bases are pre-made, allowing
you to skip the lye handling process. Common bases include
glycerin, goat milk, and shea butter.
Biodegradability: Handmade soaps are often more biodegradable
than commercial soaps, making them a more environmentally
friendly choice.
